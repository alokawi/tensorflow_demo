trying out tensorflow_demo and visualising output with TensorBoard

# Overview
This project helps train a classifier to recognize handwritten character images MNIST digits. It uses logistic regression as it's model and trains on a small MNIST dataset before testing the trained model on it. You can view the constructed data flow graph using Tensorboard in your browser after training.
